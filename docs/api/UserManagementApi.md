### Example

* Basic Authentication (Basic Authentication):
```python

from ionoscloud.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint
# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://api.ionos.com/cloudapi/v5
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = ionoscloud.Configuration(
    host = 'https://api.ionos.com/cloudapi/v5',
)
# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples with auth method are provided below
# Configure HTTP basic authorization: Basic Authentication
configuration.username = 'YOUR_USERNAME'
configuration.password = 'YOUR_PASSWORD'
# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with ionoscloud.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = ionoscloud.UserManagementApi(api_client)
    user_id = 'user_id_example' # str | The unique ID of the user
    pretty = True # bool | Controls whether response is pretty-printed (with indentation and new lines) (optional) (default to True)
    x_contract_number = 56 # int | Users having more than 1 contract need to provide contract number, against which all API requests should be executed (optional)
    try:
        # Retrieve S3 object storage single signon URL for the given user
        api_response = api_instance.um_users_s3ssourl_get(user_id, pretty=pretty, x_contract_number=x_contract_number)

# Examples with auth method are provided below
# Configure Api Key access token for authorization: Token Authentication
configuration.api_key = {
    'Token Authentication': 'YOUR_API_TOKEN',
}
# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with ionoscloud.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
