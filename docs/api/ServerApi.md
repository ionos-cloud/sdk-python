# **datacenters_servers_delete**
> object datacenters_servers_delete(datacenter_id, server_id, pretty=pretty, depth=depth, x_contract_number=x_contract_number)

Delete a Server

This will remove a server from your datacenter; however, it will not remove the storage volumes attached to the server. You will need to make a separate API call to perform that action

### Example

* Basic Authentication (Basic Authentication):
```python

### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description  | Notes |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **datacenter_id** | **str**| The unique ID of the datacenter |  |
| **server** | [**Server**](Server.md)| Server to be created |  |
| **pretty** | **bool**| Controls whether response is pretty-printed (with indentation and new lines) | [optional] [default to True] |
| **depth** | **int**| Controls the details depth of response objects.  Eg. GET /datacenters/[ID]  - depth&#x3D;0: only direct properties are included. Children (servers etc.) are not included  - depth&#x3D;1: direct properties and children references are included  - depth&#x3D;2: direct properties and children properties are included  - depth&#x3D;3: direct properties and children properties and children&#39;s children are included  - depth&#x3D;... and so on | [optional] [default to 0] |
| **x_contract_number** | **int**| Users having more than 1 contract need to provide contract number, against which all API requests should be executed | [optional]  |

### Return type

[**Server**](Server.md)

### Authorization

Basic Authentication, Token Authentication

### HTTP request headers

 - **Content-Type**: application/json
 - **Accept**: application/json

# **datacenters_servers_put**
> Server datacenters_servers_put(datacenter_id, server_id, server, pretty=pretty, depth=depth, x_contract_number=x_contract_number)

Modify a Server

Allows to modify the attributes of a Server. From v5 onwards 'allowReboot' attribute will no longer be available. For certain server property change it was earlier forced to be provided. Now this behaviour is implicit and backend will do this automatically e.g. in earlier versions, when CPU family changes, the 'allowReboot' property was required to be set to true which will no longer be the case and the server will be rebooted automatically
