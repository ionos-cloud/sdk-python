Get Locations within a Region

Retrieves the available locations in a region specified by its ID. The 'regionId' consists of the two character identifier of the region (country), e.g., 'de'.

### Example

```python
import time
import ionoscloud
from ionoscloud.rest import ApiException

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://api.ionos.com/cloudapi/v6
configuration = ionoscloud.Configuration(
    host = 'https://api.ionos.com/cloudapi/v6',
)

# Example of configuring HTTP Basic Authorization
configuration.username = 'YOUR_USERNAME'
configuration.password = 'YOUR_PASSWORD'

with ionoscloud.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = ionoscloud.LocationsApi(api_client)
    region_id = 'region_id_example' # str | The unique ID of the region.
    try:
        # Get Locations within a Region
        api_response = api_instance.locations_find_by_region_id(region_id)
        print(api_response)
    except ApiException as e:
        print('Exception when calling LocationsApi.locations_find_by_region_id: %s\n' % e)
```

Get Locations

Retrieves the available physical locations where you can deploy cloud resources in a VDC.    A location is identified by a combination of the following characters:    * a two-character **regionId**, which represents a country (example: 'de')    * a three-character **locationId**, which represents a city. The 'locationId' is typically based on the IATA code of the city's airport (example: 'txl').    >Note that 'locations' are read-only and cannot be changed.

import time

    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = ionoscloud.LocationsApi(api_client)
    try:
        # Get Locations
        api_response = api_instance.locations_get()
        print(api_response)
