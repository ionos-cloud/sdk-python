### Return type

[**KubernetesNodes**](KubernetesNodes.md)

### Authorization

Basic Authentication, Token Authentication

### HTTP request headers

 - **Content-Type**: Not defined
 - **Accept**: application/json

# **k8s_nodepools_nodes_replace_post**
> object k8s_nodepools_nodes_replace_post(k8s_cluster_id, nodepool_id, node_id, pretty=pretty, depth=depth, x_contract_number=x_contract_number)

Recreate the Kubernetes node

You can recreate a single Kubernetes Node.  Managed Kubernetes starts a process which based on the nodepool's template creates & configures a new node, waits for status \"ACTIVE\", and migrates all the pods from the faulty node, deleting it once empty. While this operation occurs, the nodepool will have an extra billable \"ACTIVE\" node.
