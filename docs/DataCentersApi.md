# **datacenters_delete**
> object datacenters_delete(datacenter_id, pretty=pretty, depth=depth, x_contract_number=x_contract_number)

Delete a Data Center

Will remove all objects within the datacenter and remove the datacenter object itself, too. This is a highly destructive method which should be used with caution

### Return type

[**Datacenter**](Datacenter.md)

### Authorization

Basic Authentication, Token Authentication

### HTTP request headers

 - **Content-Type**: application/json
 - **Accept**: application/json

# **datacenters_post**
> Datacenter datacenters_post(datacenter, pretty=pretty, depth=depth, x_contract_number=x_contract_number)

Create a Data Center

Virtual data centers are the foundation of the platform. They act as logical containers for all other objects you will be creating, e.g. servers. You can provision as many data centers as you want. Datacenters have their own private network and are logically segmented from each other to create isolation. You can use this POST method to create a simple datacenter or to create a datacenter with multiple objects under it such as servers and storage volumes.

### Return type

[**Datacenter**](Datacenter.md)

### Authorization

Basic Authentication, Token Authentication

### HTTP request headers

 - **Content-Type**: application/json

# **datacenters_put**
> Datacenter datacenters_put(datacenter_id, datacenter, pretty=pretty, depth=depth, x_contract_number=x_contract_number)

Modify a Data Center

You can use update datacenter to re-name the datacenter or update its description

### Example

* Basic Authentication (Basic Authentication):
```python
from __future__ import print_function
import time
import ionoscloud
from ionoscloud.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint
# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://api.ionos.com/cloudapi/v6
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = ionoscloud.Configuration(
    host = 'https://api.ionos.com/cloudapi/v6',
)
# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples with auth method are provided below
# Configure HTTP basic authorization: Basic Authentication
configuration.username = 'YOUR_USERNAME'
configuration.password = 'YOUR_PASSWORD'
# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with ionoscloud.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = ionoscloud.DataCentersApi(api_client)
    datacenter_id = 'datacenter_id_example' # str | The unique ID of the datacenter
    datacenter = ionoscloud.Datacenter() # Datacenter | Modified Data Center
    pretty = True # bool | Controls whether response is pretty-printed (with indentation and new lines) (optional) (default to True)
    depth = 0 # int | Controls the details depth of response objects.  Eg. GET /datacenters/[ID]  - depth=0: only direct properties are included. Children (servers etc.) are not included  - depth=1: direct properties and children references are included  - depth=2: direct properties and children properties are included  - depth=3: direct properties and children properties and children's children are included  - depth=... and so on (optional) (default to 0)
    x_contract_number = 56 # int | Users having more than 1 contract need to provide contract number, against which all API requests should be executed (optional)
    try:
        # Modify a Data Center
        api_response = api_instance.datacenters_put(datacenter_id, datacenter, pretty=pretty, depth=depth, x_contract_number=x_contract_number)
        pprint(api_response)
    except ApiException as e:
        print('Exception when calling DataCentersApi.datacenters_put: %s\n' % e)
```

* Api Key Authentication (Token Authentication):
```python

configuration = ionoscloud.Configuration(
    host = 'https://api.ionos.com/cloudapi/v6',
)
# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples with auth method are provided below
# Configure Api Key access token for authorization: Token Authentication
configuration.api_key = {
    'Token Authentication': 'YOUR_API_TOKEN',
}
# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with ionoscloud.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = ionoscloud.DataCentersApi(api_client)
    datacenter_id = 'datacenter_id_example' # str | The unique ID of the datacenter
    datacenter = ionoscloud.Datacenter() # Datacenter | Modified Data Center
    pretty = True # bool | Controls whether response is pretty-printed (with indentation and new lines) (optional) (default to True)
    depth = 0 # int | Controls the details depth of response objects.  Eg. GET /datacenters/[ID]  - depth=0: only direct properties are included. Children (servers etc.) are not included  - depth=1: direct properties and children references are included  - depth=2: direct properties and children properties are included  - depth=3: direct properties and children properties and children's children are included  - depth=... and so on (optional) (default to 0)
    x_contract_number = 56 # int | Users having more than 1 contract need to provide contract number, against which all API requests should be executed (optional)
    try:
        # Modify a Data Center
        api_response = api_instance.datacenters_put(datacenter_id, datacenter, pretty=pretty, depth=depth, x_contract_number=x_contract_number)
        pprint(api_response)
    except ApiException as e:
        print('Exception when calling DataCentersApi.datacenters_put: %s\n' % e)
```
